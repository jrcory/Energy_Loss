To run:

`source env_fishtank.sh`: make sure you have root loaded

`root example_macro.C`

This will load in the two energy loss tables in this folder for Fe26 in He gas at 1atm and calculate the energy loss and range. 

FROM JORDAN: ensure lise tables are in units of MeV/um or this will not work, it is hard to tell from lise file alone so remake the file if results differ from srim by a lot
